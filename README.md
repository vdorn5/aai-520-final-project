# AAI 520 Final Project - Group 4

## Investment Research Agentic AI

An autonomous multi-agent system for performing dynamic, self-improving investment research using LLMs, financial data APIs, and structured agent workflows. Built with [CrewAI](https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewAI) and [LangGraph](https://docs.langgraph.dev/) to orchestrate specialist agents in a collaborative research pipeline.

### Project Overview

This project implements an **Agentic Research Assistant AI** that performs comprehensive analysis of a stock ticker by:

- Ingesting and summarizing financial news
- Analyzing company earnings and SEC filings
- Assessing macroeconomic indicators
- Self-critiquing output and refining performance over time

It leverages core **agentic AI patterns**:

- Prompt Chaining  
- Routing to Specialist Agents  
- Evaluatorâ€“Optimizer Feedback Loop  
- Learning Across Runs via Memory

## Agents & Responsibilities

| Agent             | Role                                                                 |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `OrchestratorAgent` | High-level planner, routes tasks to specialist agents, assembles final report |
| `NewsAnalystAgent`  | Ingests news, classifies sentiment, extracts entities, and summarizes |
| `EarningsAnalystAgent` | Parses financial statements, extracts metrics, interprets SEC filings |
| `MarketAnalystAgent`   | Contextualizes macroeconomic trends using FRED + market data |
| `CriticAgent`        | Evaluates analysis quality and generates feedback (Evaluator-Optimizer) |

## Prerequisites
1. Docker: Install Docker on your machine. 
2. Visual Studio Code: Install Visual Studio Code.
3. Remote - Containers Extension: Install the "Remote - Containers" extension for VS Code from the Extensions Marketplace.

## Quick Start Guide

1. Begin by cloning the repository that contains the development container configuration:

```
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

2. Open the Project in VS Code. `code .`
3. Rebuild and Open the Container. Use the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P on macOS) to select Remote-Containers: Rebuild Container. VS Code will build the Docker image based on the configuration in the .devcontainer directory and open the project inside the container. *Note: You want to rebuild and reopen from the same folder this project is cloned to, otherwise vscode will create its own devcontainer at the current folder.*
4. Once inside the development container, you can use juputer notebooks (without an exposed port).

## Additional Features

#### Eporting a Jupyter Notebook as PDF. 

*Note: Current devcontainer setup has Pandoc and other packages commented out. Would need to rebuild to use this.*
You can add a `--output` flag if you want to specify the output file name otherwise it will use the file_name of your .ipynb.
```
jupyter nbconvert --to pdf <file_name.ipynb>
```
